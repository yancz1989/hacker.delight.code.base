/*
Given the "order" n of a Hilbert curve and a distance s along the curve,
this program computes the corresponding (x, y) coordinates.  The square
that the Hilbert curve traverses is of size 2**n by 2**n.
   The method is that given in [Lam&Shap], described by the following
table.  Here i = n-1 for the most significant bit of x and y, and i = 0
for the least significant bits.

              s[2i+1:2i]   x[i]  y[i]  x[i-1:0]  y[i-1:0]
              -----------|-------------------------------
                   00    |  0     0    y[i-1:0]  x[i-1:0]
                   01    |  0     1    x[i-1:0]  y[i-1:0]
                   10    |  1     1    x[i-1:0]  y[i-1:0]
                   11    |  1     0   ~y[i-1:0] ~x[i-1:0]

To use this table, start at the least significant two bits of s (i = 0).
If they are both 0 (first row), set the least significant bits of x and
y to 0 and 0 respectively, and interchange x and y.  The last two
columns designate an interchange of the bits of x and y to the right of
bit i, but on this first iteration they are null, so there is no
interchange to do.  If the least significant two bits of s are 10 (third
row), set the least significant bits of x and y to 1, and similarly for
the other rows.
   Then, consider the next least significant two bits of s, and select
the appropriate row of the table to determine the next bits of x and y,
and how to change the bits of x and y to the right of i.  Continue until
the most significant bits of x and y have been processed. */
